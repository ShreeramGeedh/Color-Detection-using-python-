# Colour-Detection-using-python-
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Simple
isn’t it? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is
not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into
color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the
brain.
 Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain
lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to
detect color names.
Color Detection In this color detection Python project, we are going to build
an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color
by clicking on them.
So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values.
Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

## The Dataset
Colours are made up of 3 primary colours; red, green, and blue. In computers,
we define each colour value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways
we can define a colour? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are
approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset,
we need to map each color’s values with their corresponding names. But
don’t worry, we don’t need to map all the values. We will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names. The CSV file for
our dataset has been taken from this link:

## Colors Dataset
The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex
values.
